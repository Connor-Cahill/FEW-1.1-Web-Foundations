  Your job: 
  
  - Adjust the font sizes for the heading, subheading, and body paragraphs
    - You want to create a clear division between each of these items. 
    - Use font size, weight, and color.

      In mathematics, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion">
      octonions</a> are a normed division algebra over the real numbers, 
      meaning it is a <em>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercomplex_number" title="Hypercomplex number">hypercomplex</a></em>; 
      Octonions are usually represented by the capital letter 
      <strong>O</strong>, using 
      boldface <b>O</b> or blackboard <span>&Omicron;</span>. Octonions have eight 
      dimensions; twice the number of dimensions of the quaternions, of 
      which they are an extension. They are noncommutative and 
      nonassociative, but satisfy a weaker form of associativity; namely, 
      they are alternative.</p>
